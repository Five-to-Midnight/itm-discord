## 2025-10-06 — ITM Discord: roles, channels, onboarding (v1)
**Why:** Activity dipped after merging to one channel; want higher signal and a path for premium without hiding the community.
**Outcome:**
- Role‑gated visibility via short onboarding; members can re-run it anytime.
- Enable “Apply to Join” for **new** members (existing stay).
- **Premium** category (initial):
  - `#premium-announcements` (read‑only)
  - `#itm-options-trades` (read‑only)
  - `#community-trades` (discussion)
  - `#ask-me-anything` (tentative in premium; we’ll test)
- **General:** keep `#general`; drop `#off-topic-lounge` to reduce duplication.
- **Analysis & Tools:** add Robinhood forum/channel for FAQs.
- **Learning:** `#faq-and-guides` (tagged; Adam to help seed).
- **Community:** `#off-topic`, add `#sports-bets` (incl. binaries).
- **Archives:** add an Archived category; move legacy channels there.
- **Moderation:** expand volunteer mod pool; push casual talk to `#off-topic`.
- **Challenges:** monthly paper‑trading comp with leaderboard + vanity role; prize = 1 mo. premium/AutoPilot/Patreon (TBD). Note: most bots are equities‑only; options support sparse.
