Got it—here’s the content with Markdown formatting that mirrors the DOCX structure. I preserved the wording exactly and only added Markdown syntax (headings, lists). Channel names that start with `#` are escaped so they render as text, not headings.

## Phase 0 — Purpose, tone, and guardrails

### Decide

* Server purpose statement (1–2 lines): what this community is for (learning options/stocks/crypto, sharing charts, having a laugh, staying safe). This becomes the first line of the welcome page and rules intro.
* Risk stance: educational only; no signals/paid “gurus”; strong anti-spam/pump rules.
* Community vibe: casual, a little dry humor, data-curious but not stiff.

### Do

* Draft a one-paragraph blurb for the Server Guide welcome page and add a short “House Style” note (e.g., “light sarcasm welcome; personal attacks not”). The Server Guide’s resource-style pages are perfect for this, and they render cleaner than a normal chat channel.

---

## Phase 1 — Onboarding & access (foundation)

### Decide

* Onboarding questions (3–5 max): markets of interest (Options / Stocks / Crypto / All), experience (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced), off-topic opt-in, and notifications preferences.
* Verification level: Medium (email + 5 mins) or High (adds 10-minute age gate). High reduces bot spam, Medium is friendlier.
* Membership model: open join, or Apply to Join (adds an application with custom questions) if you’d like a gentle “quality” filter.

### Do

* Turn on Community Onboarding; map each answer to roles that gate the Options / Stocks / Crypto categories and Off-Topic. This also lets members reconfigure via the Channels & Roles tab later.
* Enable Rules Screening with up to 16 rules (respect, no financial advice, no pump-and-dump, disclose positions if you hype a ticker, no solicitation). Keep it short and skimmable.
* Create a Server Guide page with “New Member To-Do’s” (Read rules → Pick roles → Post an intro → See #charts-and-analysis).

---

## Phase 2 — Information architecture (MVP channel map)

### Decide

* Keep MVP tight or go broader on day one? Recommendation: launch lean; add on demand.

### Do (categories & channels)

#### Welcome & Info

* #server-guide (Resource Page) — welcome, how to use the server.
* #announcements (Announcement Channel; cross-post enabled) for new videos/major updates.
* #calendar-of-events (for livestream reminders, AMAs, challenges).
* #faq-and-guides (Resource Page) for options basics/risk checklists.

#### Trading Floor (Options / Stocks / Crypto — each gated by onboarding roles)

* #options-discussion, #stocks-discussion, #crypto-talk (use Slowmode during spikes).
* Forum: Options Forum, Stocks Forum, Crypto Forum with tags like Spreads, Straddles, Earnings Plays, Long-term, Day trade. Forums keep topics tidy and searchable.
* #charts-and-analysis (sharing charts/setups; encourage threads for deep dives).
* #flow-alerts (bot-fed; see bots in Phase 4).
* #macro-news (bot feed + human context; split discussions into threads).
* Voice: Live-Trading Voice with Text Chat in Voice + Go Live enabled for ad-hoc chart walkthroughs.

#### Community & Off-Topic

* #general (tone-setting, memes allowed within reason).
* #off-topic-lounge, optional: #fitness, #gaming, #music. Consider Activities (watch-together, chess) for icebreakers.
* Voice: 1–2 casual lounges with Soundboard (kept tasteful).

#### Events & AMAs

* Stage Channel: InTheMoney Live + companion #stage-chat text. Stages are ideal for AMAs/panels.

#### Staff

* Private: #mod-chat, #mod-log, #mod-mail (report/appeals intake).

## Phase 3 — Roles, permissions, and visual hierarchy

### Decide

* Role ladder: Admin, Moderator, Event Host, Bot Manager, Trusted Member, Verified Member, New Member.
* Linked Roles for extra trust (e.g., link “Trusted Member” to an account age or verified connection).
* Whether to pursue Server Boosting perks for Enhanced Role Styles and Server Tags (nice visual flair once you hit the boost threshold).

### Do

* Map channel permissions (forums read/write for relevant market roles; staff channels locked).
* Add tasteful role colors; when eligible, apply Enhanced Role Styles for Mods/Veterans and set a short Server Tag (“ITM”).

---

## Phase 4 — Bots, integrations, and automations (use App Directory)

### Decide

* Minimum viable bot set: moderation, price/quote, options flow, events/calendar, news. Avoid over-permissioned or shady bots; prefer App Directory listings.
* How far to go on trade alerts: purely informational (e.g., “unusual options activity feed”) vs any curated summaries (riskier).

### Do

* Add a moderation bot and turn on AutoMod (custom keyword lists: scams, pump phrases, fake “support” DMs). Set automatic timeouts for first offenses.
* Add a quotes/price bot with slash commands (e.g., /price AAPL, /earnings NVDA).
* Add an options flow bot to post to #flow-alerts with sensible rate limits.
* Add a news bot pointing to reputable sources into #macro-news. Encourage human summaries in threads.
* Optional: calendar/event bot to mirror YouTube livestreams and economic events into #calendar-of-events.

---

## Phase 5 — Safety & raid protection (non-negotiable)

### Decide

* Verification level (Phase 1) and whether to enable Apply to Join during growth spikes.
* Escalation policy (timeouts → kicks → bans) and an appeal path.

### Do

* Turn on Activity Alerts & Security Actions + Raid Protection so Discord can auto-flag join raids and trigger CAPTCHA requirements.
* Set Slowmode on high-traffic channels (5–15s is usually enough).
* In voice: enable Priority Speaker for hosts during events.
* Stand up #mod-mail for member reports and appeals; document a simple response SLA for mods (even “we’ll answer as we can today” is better than silence).

---

## Phase 6 — Engagement loops (lightweight)

### Decide

* Event cadence (e.g., monthly AMA; occasional community challenges).
* Reward model: vanity roles, shout-outs, or—later—profile perks.

### Do

* Use Polls to choose AMA topics and challenge themes; limit to 5–10 options; set a clear end time.
* Launch one recurring thread or forum tag—e.g., “Weekly Trade Review”—to normalize posting outcomes (wins and losses).
* If desired, experiment with Quests/Orbs for low-stakes engagement rewards (profile flair, bragging rights).

---

## Phase 7 — Monetization (only when the free tier hums)

### Decide

* Whether to offer Server Shop items (one-time: spreadsheets, checklists) or Server Subscriptions (monthly tiers: priority AMA queue, small-group coaching voice). Keep the public space valuable even if you add tiers.

### Do

* If monetizing, publish a short value matrix in a Resource Page so it’s transparent (what’s free vs paid). Then set up the products/tiers in Server Shop/Subscriptions.

---

## Phase 8 — Ops, insights, and iteration

### Decide

* Simple KPIs to watch monthly: % of new members who post in week 1, number of active forum posts, AMA attendance, moderation incidents.
* What you’ll prune if underused (dead channels kill vibe).

### Do

* Check Server Insights monthly; run a quick Poll each quarter: “What should we add/remove?”
* Trim or merge channels that are consistently quiet; better to be lively than sprawling.

---

## Quick snippets

### Onboarding questions (copy/paste)

* Which markets are you here for? Options / Stocks / Crypto / All
* Experience level? Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
* Off-topic chat? Yes / No
* Notifications? Announcements / Events / Both

### Rules headline (first 5)

* Be respectful. Punch up the humor, not each other.
* Educational only — no financial advice; disclose positions if you hype a ticker.
* No spam, solicitation, or pump-and-dump.
* Use the right channels; take deep dives to threads or forums.
* No DM cold-pitches; report suspicious contacts to #mod-mail. (Wire it through Rules Screening so members must accept before chatting.)

### Forum tags to seed

* Options: Spreads, Straddles, Earnings Plays, Risk Management, Newbie Qs
* Stocks: Long-term, Earnings, Momentum, Value
* Crypto: Majors, Altcoins, On-chain, Risk Talk

### Minimal viable build checklist

* Turn on Community features, Onboarding, Rules Screening, set Verification (Medium/High).
* Create Server Guide with welcome, “How to use this server,” and “New Member To-Do’s.”
* Stand up MVP categories/channels from Phase 2; apply permissions and role gates.
* Add bots (moderation, quotes, options flow, news) via App Directory; set rate limits.
* Configure AutoMod, Raid Protection, Slowmode on busy channels.
* Create Stage and schedule first AMA; test Priority Speaker.
* Seed 5–10 high-quality posts in each Forum with clear tags (show the standard you want).
* Publish a simple mod handbook in #mod-chat (timeouts → kicks → bans; tone guidelines).
* Optional: set up Boosting goals and, when eligible, apply Enhanced Role Styles + Server Tag.
